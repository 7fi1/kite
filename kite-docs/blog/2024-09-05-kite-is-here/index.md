I'm excited to announce the beta release of Kite - a free and open source Discord bot builder that makes creating custom bots accessible to everyone!

<!-- truncate -->

## What is Kite?

Kite is a modern platform that lets you build Discord bots without writing code. Using an intuitive visual interface, you can create commands, set up automations, and add interactive features to your bot with just a few clicks.

## Why Choose Kite?

### ðŸ†“ Completely Free

Unlike many alternatives, Kite is completely free to use. There are no premium features, no usage limits, and no hidden costs. We believe that bot creation tools should be accessible to everyone.

### ðŸ“– Open Source & Transparent

Kite is fully open source, meaning you can:

- Review the code for security and privacy
- Contribute to the project
- Self-host your own instance
- Trust that the platform will remain available

### ðŸŽ¯ Clean & Intuitive

We've focused on creating a streamlined, uncluttered interface that's easy to navigate. No overwhelming menus or confusing options - just the tools you need to build your bot.

### ðŸš€ Actively Developed

While Kite is still in beta and may not have every feature you can imagine, we're constantly working on improvements and new functionality. Updates are regular, and we actively listen to community feedback to prioritize the features you want most.
