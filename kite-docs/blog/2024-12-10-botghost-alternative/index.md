## What is Kite?

Kite is a modern Discord bot builder that lets you create custom bots without writing any code. Like BotGhost, it provides a visual interface to set up commands, automations, and other bot functionality. However, there are some key differences that make Kite stand out.

## Free and Open Source

One of the biggest advantages of Kite is that it's completely free and open source. While BotGhost offers a free tier, it comes with significant limitations - you can't even change your bot's status without upgrading to a paid plan. With Kite, all core features are available at no cost.

Being open source means you can:

- Review the code to ensure security and privacy
- Contribute improvements to the platform
- Self-host your own instance if you prefer
- Trust that the project will remain available long-term

## Clean and Intuitive Interface

Kite focuses on providing a streamlined, intuitive user experience. The interface is designed to be clean and clutter-free, making it easy to find and use the features you need. While BotGhost offers many features, its interface can feel overwhelming with numerous options and menus.

## Actively Developed

While Kite may not yet have every feature that BotGhost offers, it's being actively developed with regular updates and improvements. The development process is transparent, and user feedback directly influences which features are prioritized.

## When Should You Choose Kite?

Kite is ideal if you:

- Want a free, unrestricted bot builder
- Prefer a clean, straightforward interface
- Value transparency and open source software
- Don't need some of the more specialized features of BotGhost

However, if you require specific advanced features that are currently only available in BotGhost, you may want to evaluate both platforms to see which better suits your needs.
