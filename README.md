# Kite

Make your own Discord Bot with Kite for free without a single line of code. With support for slash commands, buttons, and more.

![Flow Example](./example-flow.png)

This project is very much work in progress and not ready to be used for anything serious. Only some parts of the Discord API are covered and more complex logic can not be implemented.

## High Level Progress

- [x] Slash Commands
- [x] Message Templates (MVP)
- [ ] Event Listeners
- [ ] Stored Variables (WIP)
